* The plot looks good Donny, looks like you're missing plots for the graphs all being separate figures and being subplots sharing the same axes, but those are simple and would be easy to create given you know how to do them on all the same figure. See the lecture notes on plotting if you have any questions about those ones though. Good work! - Joey
